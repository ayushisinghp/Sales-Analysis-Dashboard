# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

Project Overview:
The Data Analysis Project on Sales Data for TechnoEdge Company aims to provide valuable insights into the company's sales performance over a period of 4 years, spanning from 2019 to 2022. This project involves combining 48 monthly CSV files containing sales data, utilizing Power Query for data integration, transformation, and cleaning, and ultimately creating interactive visualizations using Power BI to analyze sales trends across categories, sub-categories, and segments.

Project Objectives:
Data Collection: Gather and compile sales data from 48 monthly CSV files, spanning the years 2019 to 2022, into a single structured dataset.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Utilize Power Query to clean, preprocess, and transform the raw data. This includes handling missing values, data type conversions,removing duplicate rows and standardizing formats to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
Data Integration: Combine the transformed data from all 32 months into a unified dataset, allowing for seamless analysis across the entire period.
Sales Analysis: Utilize Power BI's robust analytics capabilities to explore sales patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data.
Category and Sub-Category Analysis: Segment the sales data by product categories and sub-categories to identify which areas contribute most significantly to the company's revenue. Analyze the growth or decline of specific product lines over time.
Segment Analysis: Analyze sales performance across different segments of TechnoEdge's customer base. This can include customer types (e.g., retail, wholesale) or geographical segments.
Visualizations: Create interactive and visually appealing dashboards using Power BI to present key findings. Dashboards should include charts, graphs, and tables that provide a clear and concise overview of sales performance and trends.
Time Series Analysis: Perform time series analysis to identify seasonal trends, sales peaks, and troughs over the 48-month period. This can aid in demand forecasting and inventory management.
Insights and Recommendations: Summarize the key insights derived from the analysis and provide actionable recommendations to improve sales strategies and overall business performance.
